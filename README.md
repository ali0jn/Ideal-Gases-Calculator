# Ideal-Gases-Calculator
A calculator for Chemistry students. It supports SI units only for now but I will add better features to it including better interface, OCR using Neural Network algorithms.

For using the calculator, you need to download the above files and place them in a folder. If you don't have Python 2 and its required packages installed, simply click on the below link to download the Installer file.
